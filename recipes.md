A place for things I like to cook.

### Beluga Lentil Salad
Add 4 parts cooked beluga lentils to 1 part each of diced carrot, cucumber and finely diced onion.
Mix with olive oil, salt, oregano, lemon peel, acid of choice, sweetener of choice, and minced garlic to taste.

### Beetroot Feta Salad
Add 6 parts boiled, then peeled and diced (0.5 cm) beetroot with roughly 2 parts diced (0.5 cm) feta and 1 part finely minced onion to a bowl.
Add olive oil, salt, cinnamon, minced garlic and white or rice vinegar to taste.
Mix until some of the feta merges into the sauce and makes it stick to the other ingredients.

### Chickpea Salad
Cover broccoli with boiling water to lightly blanch.
Add a large can of chickpeas, a thinly sliced onion (cut root to tip), and blanched broccoli to a bowl.
Mix with olive oil, salt, cumin, Chinese black vinegar, Sriracha or chili oil, and minced garlic to taste.

### Honey Mustard Dressing
Add 1 part honey, agave syrup, or sugar syrup to 1 part mustard.
Add salt, pepper, minced garlic, herbs, and most importantly essence of vinegar (e.g. KÃ¼hne Essigessenz).
Slowly add lots of olive oil while whisking to form a proper emulsion, almost as viscous as mayonnaise.
Combine with well dried salad ingredients of choice and kneed until well combined.
