Hi, I'm David. Welcome to my website!  
I am a CS undergrad, passionate cook, part-time music nerd and interested in everything life throws at me.

Currently, I'm working on a Telegram bot for Doodle polls written in Kotlin.  
As soon as it's finished, I will write a post about it here and link the repositrory.

Take care,
David
