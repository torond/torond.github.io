I had the absolute pleasure today to listen to Tchaikovsky's amazing String Sextet in D minor. This concert was the first of many Friday lunch concerts this semester at 1:10pm Irish time (14:10 German time). It's free to attend. I for one will be sure not to miss a single one :D
They're live streamed on the MusicAtUCC YouTube channel, so join in! 
For now, have a look at today's concert if you like, the head in the lower right corner is mine lol.
